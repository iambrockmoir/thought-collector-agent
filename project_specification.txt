ThoughtCollector - Project Specification
=====================================

Project Overview
---------------
ThoughtCollector is an SMS-based system that allows users to record audio thoughts,
transcribe them, and later interact with their thoughts through text conversations.

Core Functionality
----------------
1. Receive audio messages via SMS
2. Transcribe audio to text
3. Store thoughts in database
4. Enable text-based chat with stored thoughts
5. Provide AI-powered contextual responses

Technical Architecture
--------------------
Initial Implementation (Phase 1):
- Backend: Python with Vercel Serverless Functions
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL as a service)
- SMS: Twilio
- Audio/AI: OpenAI APIs
- Hosting: Vercel (free tier)
- Vector Search: Pinecone

Functional Requirements
---------------------
1. SMS Handling
